# bin

Just some shell scripts I find useful.


## Listing:

- kbdfix: Sets KP-ENTER to Return
- tmuxs: Takes a list of directories as arguments, and opens a tmux session in
  each
- upub: Clean and update metadata from apt. Upgrade packages, and remove
  unused.
- wrap: devolved nohup, to ignore everything and just run a command
