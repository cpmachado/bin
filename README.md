# bin

Just some shell scripts I find useful.

They are bash scripts, but truly are universal, as long as you comply with
each of its dependencies.

## Listing:

- kbdfix: Sets KP-ENTER to Return
- tmuxs: Takes a list of directories as arguments, and opens a tmux session in
  each
- wrap: devolved nohup, to ignore everything and just run a command
